This project is used to log the battary health information each time the 
MacBook is put to sleep. Besides, to avoid too much logs perday, the min 
interval is set to be 12 hours between two consecutive log lines.

Installation:
----------------------------------------------
1) Create folder .batt in the home directory

2) Clone batt.sh and rc.sleep to this directory. 
Add excute permission to batt.sh by: chmod +x batt.sh

3) Install sleepwatcher. http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/
curl --remote-name "http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/sleepwatcher_2.2.tgz" 
tar xvzf sleepwatcher_2.2.tgz
cd sleepwatcher_2.2

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/man/man8 

sudo cp sleepwatcher /usr/local/sbin 
sudo cp sleepwatcher.8 /usr/local/share/man/man8 

sudo cp config/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility.plist \
     /Library/LaunchDaemons/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher.plist 

4) copy the rc.sleep to the global etc library
cd ~/.batt
sudo cp rc.sleep /etc/rc.sleep
sudo chmod +x rc.sleep

5) Lauch daemon that executes rc.sleep each time MacBook sleeps.

     /Library/LaunchDaemons/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher.plist
